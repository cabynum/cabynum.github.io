Ahhh that's refreshing...

After a year of ups and downs (mostly downs), we needed some new blood in Carolina.  The new GM gave a presser at the combine today and said some things that I really like.  For one, he's keen on taking the best player available.  This is a smart move IMO.  Our roster has been full of "depth" players, and not impact players.  You have to get the best players out there.  He also is calling for more downhill running and play action.  I think everyone tired of our gimmicks on offense last year and really wanted to see Tolbert, Stew, and DWill get between the tackles.  Hopefully that's something we can look forward to.
